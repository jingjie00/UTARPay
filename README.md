### Get Platform

### Push Route

* It handles the platform routing and `PageRouteBuilder`

### Wallets vs. Accounts
* `Wallets` have been been renamed to `Accounts` on the front-end but internally, the name `Wallet` is still used.

### Objectives vs. Goals
* `Objectives` have been been renamed to `Goals` on the front-end but internally, the name `Objectives` is still used.
